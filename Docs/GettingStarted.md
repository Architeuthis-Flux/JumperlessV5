### If you want to read a wiki generated by AI and ask it questions about how this thing works and how to use it, [**DeepWiki**](https://deepwiki.com/Architeuthis-Flux/JumperlessV5/1-overview) was surprisingly accurate (enough.)

### You probably want to install the [App](https://github.com/Architeuthis-Flux/JumperlessV5/blob/main/Docs/APP.md) first, which will auto-update your Jumperless with the latest firmware.

### And maybe check out [Releases](https://github.com/Architeuthis-Flux/JumperlessV5/releases) for the latest new features I haven't covered here.

You can also use the onboard help docs with `help` or `[some command from the menu]?`

# Here's a super-quick rundown of the how to use the thing:

## The Probe
First, keep the switch on the probe set to `Select`
![ProbeSelect](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1155f75a-f800-4bc0-ba6d-49e603ad39e2)
(If you're curious *why*: `Measure` mode allows the probe tip to be ±9V tolerant and routable like any other node, but as of yet, the code to actually do anything with it is unwritten so it just connects to DAC 0 and outputs 3.3V just like it was in `Select` mode. But the DAC is much worse at matching the RP2350B's idea of what 3.3V is *exactly*, so probing will be flaky and may be off from the rows you're tapping in `Measure`.

### To `Connect` rows, click the `Connect` button on the probe
![connectButton](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faedd0af-8ea6-4454-8f33-01ff478bb9e7)

The logo should turn blue and the LEDs on the probe should also change
![connect](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2040417f-64c3-41dd-a3d6-8c900e15445b)

Now any pair of nodes you tap should get connected as you make them. In connect mode, you're creating `bridges` (see the [glossary](#glossary-of-terms) at the bottom of this page), so connections are made in pairs. When you've tapped the first `node` in a pair, the `logo` and `Connect` text on the probe will brighten to show that you're "`holding`" a connection, and the next thing you tap will connect to that first `node`. 

If you make a mistake while `holding` a connection, click the `Connect` button and it will clear it and take you back to the first `node`. 
If you click the `Connect` button while you're not `holding` a `node`, it will leave `probe mode` and bring you back into `idle mode` (rainbowy `logo`, all 3 `probe LED`s on.)`



To connect to `special functions`, tap the corresponding `pad` near the logo, it will show you a menu on the breadboard and terminal to choose them.
![gpioTapped](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b0c45ff-b98e-4a45-87b3-d3cc5c7a4544)

(This is an ASCII version of what will show on the breadboard LEDs)

![Screenshot 2025-05-30 at 10 55 13 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc9be8f8-f99c-48cd-8e00-07fdcb426f99)

You can think of `special functions`  just like any other `node`, there's just a second step to picking them so I didn't need to put a dedicated pad for each of them. 

The other 4 `user pads` will be more remappable in the future, but for now, `top_guy` is `routable UART Tx` and `bottom_guy` is `routable UART Rx`. The building pads are for overriding colors in `idle mode` (you'll see more about that that below.)

![userPads](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6925e9ed-fb6b-46a2-b377-205107df6a78)


To get out of `Connect` mode, press the button again.

### To `Remove` rows, click the `Remove` button
![removeButton](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc020b7-f5ce-48f6-99eb-4e9a753a0329)
and the logo should turn reddish
![remove](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/297e169f-f9f5-4151-8fa2-de41ab14492f)

Now you can swipe along the `pad`s or tap them one at a time. Remember it only disconnects that `node` and anything connected to it directly, not *everything* on the `net`. So tapping say, `row 25` that's connected to `GND` won't clear everything connected to `GND`, but tapping the `-` on the rails (for `GND`) would.

The special functions work the same way, tap the pad, pick one, and it will remove it. Click the button again to get out.


##### Remember the probe is read by a resistive voltage divider, so putting your fingers on the pads (or the back sides of the 4 risers that connect those `probe sense` boards to the main board), or anything causing the probe tip not to be at a steady 3.3V will give you weird readings. 
If you can't seem to stop playing with the switch on the probe, run DAC calibration with `$` and the 3.3V `measure` mode puts out should be fairly accurate enough for probing.


## The Click Wheel
![wheel copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d69a5425-7131-46e3-8c17-a38819edfc16)

There are two kinds of presses, `click` (short press) and `hold` (long press). In general, a `click` (short) is a `yes`, and a `hold` (long) is a `no`/`back`/`exit`/`whatever`. 

To get to the menu, `click` the button and scroll through the menus, `click` will bring you into that menu, `hold` will take you back one level. If you have trouble reading stuff on the breadboard LEDs, everything is copied to the Serial terminal and the OLED (talked about below), and adjusting the brightness may help; in the menus, it's `Display Options` > `Bright` > `Menu` and then scroll around until you find a level you like, then `click` to confirm. 




# Behold! The App!
<img width="749" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-29 at 10 01 15 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0fbbca6-ec16-4a0e-ac36-b4ed1f46663a" />

Now that I've lifted my self-imposed ban on VT100 commands (for compatibility and me-spending-too-much-time-on-them reasons, but, YOLO), we've got colors now! 

But that's like the *least* cool thing the new app can do, here's a list of what's new:

- No longer a janky pile of garbage
- Firmware updating should be pretty reliable when there's a new version (falls back to instructions for how to do it manually)
- Command history and tab completion, up arrows will go through past commands and are persistent after closing
- Properly detects which port is the main Jumperless Serial and which is routable UART
- Arduino flashing from [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) works once again and is a lot more solid
  -  It installs [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) on first startup and uses it pull in libraries, compile, and flash an arduino Nano in the header
  - If the routable UART lines aren't connected when the app detects a change in the sketch file, it will connect them to flash the new code and then return them to how they were
  - [avrdude](https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude) output is shown in real time (you'd be amazed how difficult this was)
- **You can set a `slot` to point to a local Arduino sketch.ino file and it will flash if it detects a change** 
  - If you don't like using Arduino IDE or Wokwi and prefer using `vim` or `emacs` or whatever, now you can let the app handle the flashing stuff and just edit an .ino file.
  - In the app, type `menu` then `slots` and instead of entering a link to a Wokiw project, just give it a path to a file (this will be saved so you can unassign it and pick it later by name)
  - (This one is so fucking sick) 
<img width="1330" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-29 at 9 16 14 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/766dbb09-254e-45c5-8f75-358684729907" />


- Launch scripts included to easily run it from your favorite terminal emulator and not just the system default (terminal.app on macOS, Powershell on Windows, idk on Linux), just go to the directory in a terminal and run the script in [tabby](https://tabby.sh/) or whatever
- The launcher *should* kill other instances (and close their windows) that happen to be open because it's such a common issue for me at least
- Linux people are no longer red-headed stepchildren, there are proper tar.gz packages now for you nerds




Or you can use any terminal emulator you like, [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), [xTerm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/), [Tabby](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby), [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)'s Serial Monitor, whatever. The TUI is all handled from the Jumperless itself so it just needs something to print text.



# Animated rows

If it's a rail, those are animated and should be a continuous slow pulsing toward the top or bottom depending in the rail.

`ADCs` are green at 0V, and go through the spectrum to red at +5V, and get whiter hot pink toward +8V. Negative voltages are kinda blue/icy and do that same thing with the "cold" colors towards -8V.

`GPIO` as inputs are animated with a white pulsing (this might be broken in that FW release, I'm fixing that right now actually, and will just be purple/white) when floating, red for high, green for low

`GPIO` outputs will be either green or red depending on their state


# Idle mode interactions

#### The main thing is that there'a a lot more interaction that can be done outside of any particular mode (like not probing and the logo is rainbowy, I'm gonna call this idle mode here until I think of a good name)
![idle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/304d787a-c5f5-4da0-bd95-1a82bcdf83c1)

Here's what's new (all of this is in idle mode):

- Tapping nets highlights them as before, but there's a slightly different animation on the `row` you have selected from the whole `net`

- The click wheel scrolls through highlighting `rows` as if you tapped each one

- With a `row` selected, here's what you can do

  - `connect` button will bring you into probing mode with the highlighted row already selected and then spit you back out to `idle` mode once you've made a connection to another row, or click `connect` again to exit

  - `remove` will briefly turn the `row` reddish `warn` (I need to settle on a good time for this, if it feels too short or long lmk), another `remove` press will remove that `row` (just like in `probe` mode, it removes the `bridge` it's in, so just things that have a direct connection to that `row`, not the whole `net`), if you let it time out without pressing anything, the row will be unhighlighted. TL;DR, double click `remove` to remove, single click to unhighlight.

  - tapping the `building top` pad with something highlighted will open the `color picker`, (note: the color now follows the `row` instead of the net, so it can keep the colors even if you remove nets below it and they shift, this was soooo difficult until I realized I should do it by `node`). 
       - Also the color assignments are saved to a file for each slot, so they should work after a reboot and when changing `slots`
       - In the `color picker`, short clicking the probe buttons will zoom in and out, long press will confirm. The click wheel is similar, except you toggle `zoom` and `scroll` modes with short presses and long press to confirm
       Here's a demo on YouTube
       [![Here's a demo on YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/shE6NSFrH5w/3.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shE6NSFrH5w)

  - if the highlighted row is a `measurement` (`gpio input` or `adc`) it will print the state to serial and the oled

  - if the highlighted row is an `output` (`gpio output`, I'll eventually do `dacs` too) clicking the `connect` button will toggle it `high` / `low`. The `remove` button will *just* unhighlight the net (there were some choices here, like make each button assigned to high / low or allow removing them, but this felt like the best way after trying them all). I will eventually add a setting for the toggle repeat rate (set to 500ms now) and a way to set it freewheeling as a clock.
       - this *one* feature is the reason I did this whole update. And it's worth it because it's sick af.

- when selecting `gpio` in `probing` mode (tap the bottom of the 3 pads by the `logo`), there are shortcuts for `input` and `output`, the blue line on the left is `input`, red square on the right is `output`. Tapping right in the middle of a number will take you to the old written out on the top and bottom selector.


# OLED Support

First, get yourself one of these bad boys (literally any of these are fine.)

[![oled Medium](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b7c6957-3b5f-4296-a0ca-1a5517a1b83b)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDWQ2RWY/)
https://www.amazon.com/MakerFocus-Display-SSD1306-3-3V-5V-Arduino/dp/B079BN2J8V

![batchone-11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26cc687d-6ebb-40b7-9b72-7eada7a5258c)
Ignore the really cool LEDs.

They should friction fit into the SBC/SMD/OLED board included with your Jumperless V5.
![SBCBP-4 copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43232b06-380d-4e18-9aab-924e45790740)

This should copy basically any text printed on the breadboard, some people have trouble reading text on the breadboard LEDs, which is why I added all this. (if I missed something, let me know, it's a fairly new thing so I've probably forgot to add code for it to print in a bunch of places.)

To connect the data lines to the Jumperless' GPIO 7 and 8, just use the menu option `.` (that's a period). It will try to find the OLED on the I2C bus, after a few failed attempts, it'll automatically disconnect to free up GPIO 7 and 8. 

If you want to use this all the time, there's a config option to connect the OLED on startup. You can just paste this into the main menu:
```
`[top_oled] connect_on_boot = true;
```

# Config file stuff

To change any persistent settings, there's a `config` file. You can read it with `~` and edit settings by copying any of those lines, pasting it back, and changing the value to whatever you want it to be.

```

copy / edit / paste any of these lines

## Bridge array
Enter `b` in the menu. This is generally the most helpul one for me to troubleshoot what's going on if your issue has anything to do with routing or connections. It probably looks like nonsense to you but I've been in it so long it makes perfect sense to me.

## Net list
Enter 'n' in the menu to show this one. If you have anything that's doing any measurement (`gpio` input or `ADC`s), it'll stay up and live update if any of them change. (And just like basically any menu not asking for input, entering anything will bring you back to the main menu.)

# Arduino UART passthrough

With an Arduino Nano in the header and the UART lines connected, anything on those lines should be passed through to the second serial port that shows up when you plug in your Jumperless. 

(You can also set the config option ``[serial_1] print_passthrough = true;` and have it print on both. Don't worry about the baud rate, the Jumperless senses what the host computer is set to and changes the speed accordingly.

The shortcuts to connect `D0` and `D1` to the Jumperless's UART `Tx` and `Rx` is `A` to connect, and `a` to disconnect.

It will even sense when Arduino IDE is trying to upload code and twiddle the reset lines to allow you to flash code with just a single USB cable going to your Jumperless.

# 3D printable stand

[![3DStandCollage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37556876-82ce-4ba4-88f6-f9eaf46da09f)](https://www.printables.com/model/1249365-jumperless-stand)

[Here are the 3D models](https://www.printables.com/model/1249365-jumperless-stand) for you to print your own stand for your Jumperless. It's extremely handy to have it propped up like this to read text on the breadboard. 

Yes, the model is at a weird angle, just drop it down in the slicer, if you want it to hold at a shallower angle, just drop the model through the bed a bit when you slice.

These [stick-on rubber feet](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-300-Piece-Adhesive-Rubber-Bumpers/dp/B087MG3G76) also make it a lot more solid on your desk (and having the different sizes lets you shim the angle by putting different ones on the front and back.)

That's all the brand spankin' new stuff, there's some more general info in the updates on the [Crowd Supply page](https://www.crowdsupply.com/architeuthis-flux/jumperless-v5). 

Come hang out in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/bvacV7r3FP) if you have any questions or just want to chat. 



# Odds and ends


- `GPIO 1-8` will show a subtle animation while they're floating and go red / green when they're pulled `high` / `low`
 
- Added commands to just add or remove nodes `+uart_tx-43, 1-2, 2-3`, `-2-3` (will just remove the *bridge* 2-3 and leave 1-2, `-2` will remove the *node*, so both 1-2 and 2-3 will be removed)

- `x` will clear all connections in the current slot

- Configuration options are saved to a file and any option can be changed with \`, or print it out with `~` (there's also a help menu `~?`)

- Arduino flashing works through the second serial port, a DTR signal will pull down the Reset lines and then let avrdude pass through whatever. So if you tell Arduino IDE there's an Arduino Nano connected to Jumperless port 2, it should flash as expected.

- There's also a shortcut to connect the Jumperless's UART lines to D1 and D0, `a` to disconnect and `A` to connect

- You can manually toggle the 2 Reset lines with `r` (both), `rt` (top), `rb` (bottom)

- LED brightness menu updated (pro tip, try `l?`, `lc`, and `lb`)

- `v` will just return all the ADC readings once, you can do `v2` to get just ADC 2's reading

- `g` will show the state of all the `gpio`

- `#`[any text] will print text on the breadboard (type `m` or whatever to go back)

## Firmware changes in 5.1.2.7

- Commands from Routable UART
  - Starting a UART message (that would normally just be passed through to the second serial port) with `0x02` ([non-printable ASCII code for Start of Text / STX](https://www.ascii-code.com/)) and ending with `0x03` ([End of Text / ETX](https://www.ascii-code.com/)) will cause the Jumperless to interpret that as something that was sent though the menu on the main serial port. So you can send commands to make connections and such while also using serial passthrough.

## What's that `BUFFER_IN - DAC_0` bridge that's always there?

That gets added to power the `probe LEDs`, it's kinda weird, but to multiplex 3.3V, GND, LED data, 2 buttons, and a +-9V tolerant analog line over the 4 wires on a TRRS cable, the line powering those LEDs is shared.
The `connect`/`measure` switch is a Dual Pole Dual Throw (DPDT) switch. The probe tip needs to be at a steady 3.3V to be read by the `probe sense pads` which is a big resistive divider sensed by a single `ADC`.

When you have it in `select` mode, the probe tip is getting 3.3V from a `GPIO` on the RP2350B driven `high`, and the LEDs get their power from the analog line, which is `ROUTABLE_BUFFER_IN` connected to `DAC 0` set to 3.3V.

When you switch to `measure` mode, those roles get swapped, the LEDs are powered by that `GPIO`, and the probe tip is now `ROUTABLE_BUFFER_IN`. In the current firmware, that just stays at 3.3V so you can *kinda* sense pads in either mode (you may notice the sensing is a lot wonkier, that's because the `DAC` isn't perfectly calibrated to output *exactly* 3.3V.) But in the future, there will be some other stuff you can do in that mode treating it as an analog line (and of course, I'll forget to update this, if it's after like June 2025, double check this is still true.)

#### Why am I using one of the precious two DACs and not another GPIO?
The answer is switch position sensing. You may notice there's no obvious way for the Jumperless to know where the switch is set, so I had to get creative on this one. `DAC 0`'s output is hardwired to go through a `current sense` shunt resistor, so when `DAC 0` is powering the `probe LEDs`, they'll be drawing some current I can measure with one of the `INA219`s, and therefore I can be reasonably confident that the switch is in the `select` position.

If you need both `DAC`s, you can just get rid of this connection and the `probe LEDs` won't light up, but other than aesthetics, it really has no effect on functionality. Or you connect `ROUTABLE_BUFFER_IN` to a `GPIO` and set it `high` and just lose the ability to sense where the switch is.



# Glossary of terms:

`net` = a group of all the `node`s that are connected together (enter `n` to see the list {there's a colorful update to that I'm working on right now})

`node` = anything the crossbar array can connect to, which includes everything on the breadboard and Nano header, as well as the internal `special function` `node`s like `routable GPIO`, `ADC`s, `DAC`s

`row` = *kinda* the same thing as `node` but I generally use it to mean stuff on the breadboard (so special function things like `routable GPIO`, `ADC`s, `DAC`s that don't have a set location are excluded)

`rail` = I use this to refer to the 4 horizontal power rails on the top and bottom (`top_rail`, `bottom_rail`, `gnd`), I will never call a vertical `row` a `rail`. (I know they're columns but it's easier to say a lot)

`bridge` = a pair of exactly two `node`s (this is what you're making when you connect stuff with the probe, enter `s` to print the (kinda misnamed) `node file`s to see a list of bridges)

`path` = the set of crossbar connections needed to make a single `bridge`, so it can have multiple `hop`s if it doesn't have a direct connection and needs to make a `bounce` through an intermediate `chip` enter `b` to see them

`node file` / `slot file` = this is an actual text file on the filesystem that stores the list of bridges, there's one of these for each `slot` (enter `s` to see all of them, they start with an `f {` to make it east to just copy paste them from the terminal)

`slot` = one of the 8 node files stored that you can switch between with `<`/`>` or the `menu`s. Named `nodeFileSlot[0-7].txt` (there's no actual limit, there's *so* much flash storage on this thing, but by default it's 8)

`menu` = I generally mean the onboard clickwheel `menu` when I say this (`click` the wheel to enter those and `scroll` around)

`chip` = shorthand for the CH446Qs specifically, lettered A-L. The first 8 (A-H) are considered "breadboard `chips`, and the last 4 are considered "special function" chips (enter `c` to see their connections)



That's probably more than you need to worry about but that gives me a nice start on real docs
