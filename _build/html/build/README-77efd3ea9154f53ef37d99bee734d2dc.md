# MyST Quickstart

[![Made with MyST](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-myst-orange)](https://myst.tools)

This repository contains the files used in the [quickstart guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart), and can be used to follow that guide, before trying MyST with your own content.

> **Note** This is **not** a good example of an actual MyST project! The repositories purpose is to be a simple markdown + notebook repository that can be transformed throughout a tutorial.

The goals of the [quickstart guide](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/quickstart) are:

1. Create a `myst` site, using the standard template
2. Improve the frontmatter, to add authors, affiliations and other metadata
3. Export the paper as a PDF, Word document, and LaTeX files
4. Integrate a Jupyter Notebook output into our paper, to improve reproducibility
5. Publish a website of with our work ðŸš€
