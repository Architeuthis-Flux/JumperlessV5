# REPL Multiline Editing Improvements

## Overview
Completely revamped multiline editing in the Jumperless MicroPython REPL using a full buffer synchronization approach. This eliminates all display inconsistencies and ensures perfect synchronization between the internal buffer and what's displayed on screen.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Line Content Disappearing During Edit
- **Issue**: When editing a line in multiline mode, the line would clear but not show the updated content properly
- **Cause**: Partial screen updates getting out of sync with terminal state
- **Solution**: Complete buffer redraw on every keystroke ensures perfect synchronization

### 2. Inconsistent Display Updates
- **Issue**: What was typed would be executed correctly but not always displayed on screen
- **Cause**: Race conditions between incremental display updates and terminal control sequences
- **Solution**: Full buffer approach eliminates race conditions by always showing the complete current state

### 3. Cursor Positioning Issues
- **Issue**: Cursor would end up in wrong position after editing multiline content
- **Cause**: Accumulating errors from incremental cursor movement commands
- **Solution**: Precise cursor positioning calculation based on actual buffer content and cursor position

## Technical Changes

### New Full Buffer Approach

#### Core Philosophy
- **Complete Redraw**: Every keystroke triggers a full redraw of the entire input buffer
- **Buffer Synchronization**: Internal buffer state is always perfectly reflected on screen
- **Precise Positioning**: Cursor position calculated based on actual buffer content, not incremental movements
- **Accurate Line Tracking**: Fixed line clearing logic to prevent screen scrolling issues

#### Modified Functions in `src/Python_Proper.cpp`

#### `redrawFullInput()` (Enhanced)
- Now used for ALL display updates, not just specific cases
- Added `positionCursorAtCurrentPos()` for precise cursor positioning
- Completely clears display area and redraws entire buffer with proper prompts
- Handles multiline syntax highlighting correctly

#### `positionCursorAtCurrentPos()` (New)
- Calculates exact line and column position based on cursor_pos in buffer
- Accounts for prompt lengths (">>>" vs "...")
- Moves cursor to precise location using terminal control sequences
- Handles multiline navigation correctly

#### Input Handling Logic (Completely Revised)
- **All Operations**: Character input, backspace, tab, arrow keys ALL use full redraw
- **Eliminated Incremental Updates**: No more partial screen updates or character echoing
- **Perfect Consistency**: What you see is exactly what's in the buffer, always

#### Line Clearing Fix (Critical Bug Fix)
- **Issue**: Going up a line was erasing one extra line, causing screen scrolling
- **Root Cause**: `last_displayed_lines` was tracking newline count instead of actual cursor movement needed
- **Solution**: Now tracks `lines_printed` which represents lines moved down from first line
- **Result**: Perfect line clearing without unwanted screen scrolling

## Testing

### Basic Testing
1. Enter multiline mode by typing code that requires multiple lines:
```python
def test_function():
    print("line 1")
    print("line 2")
    return "done"
```

2. Use arrow keys to navigate to the middle of any line
3. Edit the content (add/remove characters)
4. Verify the line displays correctly and stays visible

### Advanced Testing
Use the comprehensive test scripts:
```bash
# Basic functionality test
exec(open('/path/to/test_multiline_editing.py').read())

# Full buffer synchronization test
exec(open('/path/to/test_full_buffer_multiline.py').read())

# Line clearing fix verification test
exec(open('/path/to/test_line_clearing_fix.py').read())
```

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ **Perfect Synchronization**: Buffer content always matches display exactly
- ✅ **Reliable Cursor Position**: Cursor always positioned correctly, never out of sync
- ✅ **Complete Redraw**: Every keystroke shows immediate, complete result
- ✅ **Multiline Navigation**: Arrow keys work perfectly in complex multiline structures
- ✅ **No Display Artifacts**: No leftover characters or partial line updates
- ✅ **Syntax Highlighting**: Works correctly across all multiline content
- ✅ **Edit Anywhere**: Can edit any character in any line without display issues

## Memory Usage
The full buffer approach uses slightly more resources but ensures reliability:
- Complete buffer redraw on each keystroke (acceptable performance impact)
- Enhanced cursor position calculation
- Eliminated incremental update complexity
- Overall more reliable and maintainable code

## Backward Compatibility
All changes are fully backward compatible:
- Existing REPL functionality unchanged
- All keyboard shortcuts and commands work as before
- History navigation still works perfectly
- File operations and special commands unchanged

## Performance Impact
- **Multiline editing**: Small increase in redraw time, but perfect reliability
- **Single-line editing**: Same full redraw approach, consistent experience
- **Terminal responsiveness**: Improved due to elimination of synchronization issues
- **Visual feedback**: Immediate and always accurate display updates

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Optional performance optimization: Only redraw when buffer actually changes
- [ ] Add configurable redraw modes (full vs. smart) for different terminal capabilities
- [ ] Implement line wrapping for extremely long lines (>terminal width)
- [ ] Add visual indicators for multiline mode status
- [ ] Consider terminal size detection for adaptive display

## Technical Architecture

### Buffer Management
- **Single Source of Truth**: `current_input` string contains entire buffer
- **Cursor Tracking**: `cursor_pos` integer tracks character position in buffer
- **Display Synchronization**: `redrawFullInput()` ensures screen matches buffer exactly

### Terminal Control Flow
1. **Input Received** → Update buffer (`current_input`) and cursor position (`cursor_pos`)
2. **Full Redraw** → Clear display area, redraw entire buffer with syntax highlighting
3. **Cursor Positioning** → Calculate exact screen position and move cursor there
4. **Flush** → Ensure all terminal commands are processed

### Key Benefits
- **Eliminates State Drift**: No accumulation of display/buffer mismatches
- **Predictable Behavior**: Every keystroke produces same result regardless of history
- **Easier Debugging**: Single redraw function handles all display logic
- **Robust Navigation**: Arrow keys work correctly in any multiline scenario
