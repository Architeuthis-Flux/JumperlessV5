    Test to demonstrate the performance improvement of the net color tracking system.

    1. Stores net color files in /net_colors/ directory
    2. Tracks which slots have colors with a bitmask (slotsWithNetColors)
    3. Skips file operations for slots with no colors
    4. Removes empty files to keep filesystem clean
    5. Tracks which slots have been validated (slotsValidated bitmask)
    6. Skips validation for slots already validated until modified
