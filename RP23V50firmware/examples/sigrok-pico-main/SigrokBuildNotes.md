With the release to mainline libsigrok, there are no special build commands neeed, follow whatever the latest recommendations are on the main sigrok pages.
As a warning, trying to resolve all of the library dependencies on your given OS/VM etc. is the greatest challenge.  That is intrinsic to building PulseView in general, not to to this library.
It is generally recommended to try to get the sigrok-cli built and operational first, as that will ensure you have the correct USB/serial and other libraries.
Good-luck!
