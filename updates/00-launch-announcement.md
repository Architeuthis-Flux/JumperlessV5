Start growing your wizard beards and dusting off your pointy blue hats, because the Jumperless V5 campaign is now live!

It's been really fun getting it to this point, but the best part is still to come: seeing all the awesome things you do with your Jumperlesses!

This community really has brought together some of the chillest, most interesting people I've ever met. So come hang out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CKP2chvcUt) or in [our Forum](https://forum.jumperless.org/) and ask them about their experiences with the OG Jumperless. I'm always there and happy to answer any questions you might have or just to chat about your own projects, even if you don't plan on getting yourself a Jumperless v5.

Throughout the campaign, I'll be posting these updates every week, and they'll usually include a deep-ish dive into how some particular aspect of this thing works. So, if you have any requests for what I should cover, just let me know!

Love,  
Kevin
