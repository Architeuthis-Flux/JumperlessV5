# Jumperless V5
 The next generation [jumperless breadboard](https://github.com/Architeuthis-Flux/Jumperless)

More LEDs, fewer jumpers!

Here's a list of the new stuff being added to V5:
- a separate probe sensing system  (so rows can be selected without disconnecting and scanning the whole board)
- 5 LEDs under each row  (so the breadboard itself can display measurements, text, video, whatever)
- a rotary encoder/button  (so you can navigate menus without looking at a computer)
- 10 GPIO (4 5V, 6 3.3V) that can be routed anywhere  (so you can talk to chips on the breadboard, or logic analyze them)
- a daisy chain header on both sides  (so you can stick a bunch of these together and route 8 fully analog signals between boards)
- a TRRRS audio jack for the probe  (so you can select rows, measure voltage and add an I2C display)
- 2 arbitrarily programmable power rails  (so you can set each one separately to any voltage within +-8V)
- 2 more routable high-current DACs, 3 +- 8V buffered ADCs, a routable op amp buffer (so you're not losing any features of the original Jumperless)
- a USB-C port  (so you can shut the fuck up about my love for USB Mini)
