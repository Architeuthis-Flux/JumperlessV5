# SafeString
This SafeString library is designed for beginners to be a safe, robust and debuggable replacement for string processing in Arduino and provides non-blocking text I/O and parsing and testing for Real World use.

This library includes:-  
* **SafeString**, a safe, robust and debuggable replacement for string processing in Arduino  
* **SafeStringReader**, a non-blocking tokenizing text reader replacement for Serial read()  
* **BufferedOutput**, non-blocking replacement for Serial print()  
* **SafeStringStream**, a stream to provide test inputs for repeated testing of I/O sketches   
* **BufferedInput**, extra buffering for text input  
* **loopTimer**, (loopTimerClass) to track of the maximum and average run times for the loop()  
* **millisDelay**, a non-blocking delay replacement, with single-shot, repeating, restart and stop facilities.  
* **PinFlasher**, a non-blocking flashing of an output pin.  
* **SerialComs**, to send messages between Arduinos via Serial

  To create SafeStrings use one of the four (4) macros **createSafeString** or **cSF**, **createSafeStringFromCharArray** or **cSFA**, **createSafeStringFromCharPtr** or **cSFP**, **createSafeStringFromCharPtrWithSize** or **cSFPS**<br> 
  For example sketches see SafeString_ConstructorAndDebugging.ino, SafeStringFromCharArray.ino, SafeStringFromCharPtr.ino and SafeStringFromCharPtrWithSize.ino<br>
  and the [SafeString Tutorial](https://www.forward.com.au/pfod/ArduinoProgramming/SafeString/index.html)

# Sparkfun SAMD compile issue  
See issue https://github.com/PowerBroker2/SafeString/issues/73  

Sparkfun's SAMD board support does not provide a define to distinguish it from Arduino's SAMD boards.  
This causes SafeString compile to fail with  
    
 **error: expected class-name before '{' token 73 | class SafeStringReader : public SafeString {**      

This fix is to remove the contents of these three header files  
SafeStringNameSpace.h  
SafeStringNameSpaceEnd.h  
SafeStringNameSpaceStart.h  

That is just have empty files for those three headers.  

# PlatformIO support
This library is primarily an Arduino IDE library, but users have had success using it with PlatformIO.  
See the PlatformIO subdirectory for the two PlatformIO versions.  One for boards that use the arduino namespace, e.g. Arduino Zero, and one for boards that don't, e.g. UNO.
To see which board yours is, check the Print.h file and see if it includes the lines   

    namespace arduino {  
    class Print    

If it does, then unzip the SafeStringIO_namespace.zip and use that library.  If it does not, then unzip the SafeStringIO.zip and use that library.

# Revisions
V4.1.34 fixed SafeStringLengthTrim example (removed unsupported setLength() calls)  
V4.1.33 fix for bool for SAM boards  
V4.1.32 added support for Adafruit SAMD boards  
V4.1.31 added support for other Arduino MBED boards like Opta   
V4.1.30 added default initializations   
V4.1.29 removed F() macro and FlashStringHelper class from SafeString.h.  SafeString now depends of the board's core to define these.
